Project Covid Store


This project used C++ to effictvely update how many people could come into the store.I created this project during the pandemic and it was really cool to see the use of C++ in the real world with such a simple program that I created with very little coding knowledge. There are multiple things wrong with the project but as an introductory course, I was happy with what I was able to do.
