# Project_1

This repository has my resume and everything else related to project 1. I am a senior in Computer Science here at Akron University. I will be graduating in 
May 2023 and currenelty deciding on my current offers on where I want to land after graduation. The personal project I uploaded and talked about in this project, is a project I created from little starting code I got in class. It was for a shopping mall or anything to record the amount of people in the store at one time to make sure they were following covid guidlines. This project was coded in C++ and turned in for school.
